                <h2><small>Episode 1</small>Building a Foundation for Performance at Pinterest <b>with Michelle Vu</b></h2>
                <p>On today’s episode we sit down with Marcy Sutton—a senior front end engineer at Deque Systems, where she works on accessibility. We talk about the intersection and differentiations in performance and accessibility. Marcy explains that there’s a huge audience that’s being missed by not making your website accessible.</p>
